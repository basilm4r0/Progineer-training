## Tasks assigned in my design verification training at Progineer

### 1st task:
####    - Part A: create a shell script to do the following:
        1. Create a tmp dir in your home dir.
        2. Create 5 sub dir in tmp, with names training_project_<index num>
        3. In each sub dir, create 2 txt files named module_<index num>_a.txt and module_<index num>_b.txt
        4. In each file add the command: echo “Hello <your first name/ last name> welcome to file <indexnum>.<A/ B>”

####    - Part B: the same as the first, except that instead of your first and last name being hard coded, the script should read them from 2 environment variables.
####    - Part C: the first and last names should be passed using shell script args. Also add the optional -cap arg. Your script should have a help arg and the user is not required to use a specific order for the args.
